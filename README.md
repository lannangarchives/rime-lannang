# rime-lannang
Rime recipe for Philippine Hokkien.
This is an input method for Philippine Hokkien Chinese characters.
This requires a (RIME client for your platform)[https://rime.im/] (Chinese).

## Current version notes
The current ```lannang.dict.yaml``` is an ongoing edited version of a-thok's dictionary from [```rime-hokkien```](https://github.com/a-thok/rime-hokkien). Therefore, a lot of romanizations that appear in the input box comments will not be recognizable in any of the popular romanization schemes (Pe̍h-ōe-jī, Tâi-lô, Lannang Orthography*, Hui-di*).<br><br>
We aim to revamp the entire dictionary to suit words, pronunciations, and phrases used frequently in Philippine Hokkien.
<br>
<br>
\**these are recently created romanization schemes made in the Philippines but, however, are not popular as of recent. Creation date ranges from 2019-2020.*
